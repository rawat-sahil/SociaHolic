An attempt to develop a website similar to facebook using django framework 2.2.5.

There are some minor bugs in the payment system which need to be rectified but i am too lazy to change the code.(-_-)
Before running the website check the settings file and do change the settings that are necessary.

you can run the website with 
```sh
python3 manage.py makemigration
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py runserver
```
